#Place Content Repository#

The *"Place Content"* fixup in callas pdfToolbox is designed to add additional content to existing PDF documents. It does so through the use of HTML templates, which are converted to PDF and added on top or in the back of the PDF document being processed.

Such templates can be started from scratch (they are _just_ HTML after all), but it is often simpler to either start from an  example or at least use a collection of support Javascripts / HTML snippets / CSS files.

This GitHub repository is used to maintain the templates and examples of said HTML templates. You can use it to always get the latest version of the scripts and examples, or you can submit your own changes for others to use. In the unlikely event there are any _bugs_ in what we share here, you can use GitHub to submit your corrections.
