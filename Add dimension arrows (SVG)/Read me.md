#Add dimension arrows (SVG)#

This example uses SVG to draw an arrow on the left hand side and at the bottom of the trimbox of a PDF document (the PDF should have sufficient white space (> 10mm) around the trimbox for this to work correctly).

In the center of the two arrows, the width and height of the trimbox is shown in mm.
