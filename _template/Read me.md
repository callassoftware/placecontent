#The 'template' Template#

The *"Place Content"* fixup in callas pdfToolbox uses an HTML file and converts it to PDF. This gives you a lot of liberty in how to structure your HTML, in how you link to other files such as scripts, CSS and fonts and in how to structure the folder you use to hold that template.

In this template folder you find one possible way to do this. You'll find a liberal use of sub folders and CSS and Javascripts that are referred to, rather than included in the HTML file. You're _free to follow this standard_ or implement your own. Anything that would work for a normal HTML file, will also work here.
